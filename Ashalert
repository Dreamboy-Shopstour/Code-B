# AshAlert: Volcanic Ash Monitoring System

**Hackathon Project | Climate Resilience | Philippines**

AshAlert is a low-cost, IoT-powered sensor system designed to detect and monitor volcanic ashfall in real time. It aims to protect communities in ash-prone areas like Alabat Island, Bicol, and Mindoro by providing early detection, alert systems, and actionable data.

---

## Problem Addressed

The Philippines faces frequent volcanic eruptions. Ashfall can:
- Disrupt agriculture, power, and transport
- Cause serious health issues
- Blindside unprepared communities

Yet, **there’s no low-cost, community-level monitoring system** to detect ashfall before it spreads.

---

## Solution

**AshAlert** uses:
- **Dust sensors (e.g., GP2Y1010AU0F or PMS5003)**
- **Microcontrollers (Arduino / ESP32)**
- **Solar-powered battery setups**
- **Wi-Fi or LoRa for remote areas**
- **Dashboard + SMS Alert system**

The goal: *A decentralized, accessible system for LGUs, barangays, and schools.*

---

## Features

- Real-time ashfall density detection
- Local alert system (buzzer/SMS)
- Community dashboard (web-based)
- Cloud data storage (e.g., Firebase)
- Mobile-friendly display

---

## Tech Stack

- Arduino / ESP32
- Dust Sensor (PM2.5/PM10)
- Firebase / Blynk / ThingsBoard
- Node.js + React (for dashboard)
- Globe SMS API / Twilio (alerts)

## System Architecture

[Sensor Unit] --> [Microcontroller] --> [WiFi/LTE/LoRa] --> [Cloud DB] --> [Dashboard + Alert System]

---

## How to Use

1. Assemble the sensor unit (see `/hardware`)
2. Upload Arduino code (`/firmware`)
3. Deploy dashboard (`/web`)
4. Configure alert thresholds in config

---

## Project Status

- [x] Sensor prototype working
- [x] Firebase integration done
- [ ] Dashboard UI in progress
- [ ] SMS alert system pending
- [ ] Field testing in Alabat Island (planned)

---

## Roadmap

- Add AI prediction based on eruption history
- Partner with PHIVOLCS & LGUs
- Integrate with Shopstour awareness campaigns
- Expand to typhoon/landslide alerts
